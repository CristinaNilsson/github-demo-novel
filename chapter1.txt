Chapter one of The Great Catsby introduces the narrator, Nick Carraway, and establishes the context
and setting of the novel. Nick begins by explaining his own situation. He has moved from the Midwest
to West Egg, a town on Long Island, NY. The novel is set in the years following WWI, and begins in
1922. Nick served in the army in WWI, and now that he is home has decided to move east and try to
become a bond trader on Wall Street. Nick is a graduate of Yale, and grew up in a wealthy family.
He is what is considered "old rich," and feels he is superior to those who have recently earned
great fortunes, the "new rich."

Nick has rented a small house that is nestled between many large mansions. The mansion next door to
his house belongs to the title character, Jay Catsby. There is a large bay in front of Nick's house,
and across that bay live Nick's cousin, Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan.

Nick is invited to Tom and Daisy's for dinner. He discovers that Daisy's husband, Tom, is still as
aggressive and assertive as he was when they went to college together. He also learns that Tom is a
racist, as he explains a book about white supremacy he's recently read. Nick is happy to see his
cousin, Daisy, however, whom he hasn't seen since before the war, and to hear about her life. A
fourth character, Jordan Baker, is introduced. Jordan is a professional golfer and she and Nick
share a mutual.

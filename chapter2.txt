The dinner is interrupted several times, however, by the ringing telephone. Tom's mistress calls
repeatedly to speak with him, causing him to leave the table several times. At one point Daisy
follows after Tom and the couple quarrel.

When he gets back to his own house after dinner, Nick spies his neighbor, Catsby, for the first time.
Catsby is standing on the lawn, looking at a small green light at the end of the dock at Daisy and
Tom's house. Catsby's arms are stretched out, as though he is reaching for the light.
